EXPERIENCE
Data Analyst /Co-Founder | HealthMappers	July 2022-Sep 2024
•	Designed and implemented scalable healthcare analytics solutions, transitioning processes from Excel to Python-based workflows for enhanced efficiency. Collaborated with cross-functional team to integrate diverse data sources.
•	Developed a pipeline for drug surveillance by integrating data from clinicaltrials.gov, Pubmed.gov, and Snowflake. Automated the data input and transformation process with SQL and Python, for structured/unstructured data, and built dashboards to track strategic metrics and KPI’s. 
•	Developed pipeline to analyze RWD of 20,000+ patient reviews and media reports using NLP (NLTK,SpaCy,pyLDAvis) in consultation with key stakeholders. Used sentiment analysis to identify shifts in public perception over time. 
•	Conducted impact analysis of trial failures using publicly available data to identify key drivers of early termination that could inform policy recommendations.
•	Utilized Python’s NetworkX to construct interactive network graphs that mapped relationships between entities such as healthcare providers and clinical trial sites. 

Research Data Scientist | Texas A & M 	Aug 2016- Sep 2020
•	Managed and analyzed complex datasets exceeding 1 million data points using Python, R, SQL and Excel, achieving a 20% improvement in processing efficiency.
•	Developed custom statistical models and visualizations that translated intricate biological data into actionable insights. Conducted in-depth data analysis on vector-control strategies, leveraging statistical methods and advanced analytics to assess the impact of interventions on vector-borne disease.
•	Streamlined data workflows and quality control processes using Excel automation (Macros, VBA), reducing analysis turnaround times by 30%.

Research Associate | Virginia Tech 	June 2015- Aug 2016
•	Cross-Functional Analytics: Developed custom statistical models and visualizations that translated intricate biological data into actionable insights, contributing to cross-functional decisions. 
•	Documentation and Reporting: Documented experimental workflows and results in comprehensive reports for data traceability and quality control. Created clear, concise data visualizations and reports for both technical and non-technical audiences.
